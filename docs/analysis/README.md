# Analysis Index

Background and rationale behind the M.E.Doc update detection algorithm. These documents
capture the finalized analysis/research that backs the current design.

- [Update Detection Rationale](update-detection-rationale.md) — why the 2-marker system is
  reliable, classification logic, and search strategy details.
- [Implementation Plan (Phase 1)](implementation-plan-phase1.md) — summary of refactor
  from 3 flags to 2 markers, helper functions, and return shape changes.
- [Log Corpus Summary](log-corpus-summary.md) — high-level stats from manual corpus
  review (counts, date range, encoding notes).

These documents replace the exploratory notes that were previously under `analysis/phase-*`.
They are the source of truth for the "science behind the task."
